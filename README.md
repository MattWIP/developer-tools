### Shopify Developer Tools
Whether you’re new to Shopify development and just learning about our APIs and SDKs, or you’re an existing developer who wants quick access to a particular resource, the Developer Tools app brings Shopify right into to your development workflow. 
Once installed, the app allows you to interact with and learn about the Admin API, view and customize Polaris components, and generate realistic dummy data for your development store.
